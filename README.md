# Predictive modelling for complications during hospital admission #
## SHADE'22 Datathon (https://sg-ai.org/)
## Team 6 (Amber Chung, Li Chuan, Teo Wei Quan, Emma Goh, Adam Quek, JJ)

### Background:
- Patients may have longer length of stay (LLOS: â‰¥5 days) due to a myriad of reasons
- Duty of the healthcare team to discharge patients as well as possible
- Positive correlation between longer length of stay and secondary complications

### Aim of model:
- To investigate (vis predictive modelling) on complications (acute lungs and kidney failure) in acute myocardial infarction patient during stay in ICU

### Data source:
- Pollard, T., Johnson, A., Raffa, J., Celi, L. A., Badawi, O., & Mark, R. (2019). eICU Collaborative Research Database (version 2.0). PhysioNet. https://doi.org/10.13026/C2WM1R\

### Data Population:
- Patients admitted with myocardial infarction (based on ICD code) (n = 1835)
